## 🔐 Security Reminders

Before deploying to production:

1. **Generate Strong JWT Secret**
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

2. **Use Strong Database Password**
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Mix of letters, numbers, special characters
   - Not related to username or domain

3. **Enable HTTPS/SSL**
   - Use AutoSSL in control panel
   - Redirect HTTP → HTTPS

4. **Set Up Backups**
   - Enable daily database backups
   - Test backup restoration

5. **Monitor Logs**
   - Check error logs daily
   - Review console errors in browser
   - Set up log aggregation if possible

npm run build
ls -la dist/ | head -20

# 2. Backend build check
cd server && npm run build
ls -la dist/ | head -20
cd ..

# 3. Environment files check
ls -la .env.production.example
ls -la server/.env.production.example

# 4. Database schema check
wc -l server/schema.sql

# 5. Git status check
git status | grep -E "^On branch|^nothing to commit"
```
