## Coverage Areas

### ✅ Unit Tests Cover:
- Age category calculations (U10, U12, U14, U16, U18)
- Performance comparison logic (time-based vs distance-based events)
- Statistical calculations (average, best result, improvement rate)
- Access control verification
- Data filtering and search functionality
- Input validation (emails, names, ages, dates)

### ✅ Integration Tests Cover:
- Complete athlete lifecycle (create, update, delete)
- Multi-athlete management per coach
- Performance tracking over time
- Access request workflow (pending → approved/rejected)
- Coach-parent messaging system
- Conversation threading
- Unread message counting

### ✅ Edge Cases Cover:
- Empty arrays and null values
- Boundary conditions
- String operations and special characters (Romanian diacritics)
- Decimal precision in performance metrics
- Date parsing and comparison
- Case-insensitive operations
